Nbody-problem
=============

nbody-problem-android

Implementation of the n-body problem for an Android application in order to see the difference of performance between unoptimized code and code using RenderScript.

N-body problem : In physics, the n-body problem is a classical problem of predicting the individual motions, and forces on same, of a group of celestial objects interacting with each other gravitationally.

Future improvement :

    add the ability to do calculations with NDK.
    using of OpenGL ES 1 for renderer.
    improvement of OpenGL ES 2 renderer in order to compare if there is a difference of performance with OpenGL ES 1.
    development of an algorithm which adjust the nomber of bodies in order to make smooth animation.
